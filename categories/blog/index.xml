      <description>Today, by my count, is the 19th consecutive day that I have posted on this blog, and I&#39;ve realized that it is a bit untenable for me to continue to post on a daily basis. To that end, I&#39;ll be shifting to weekly updates so that I don&#39;t feel as rushed and can put out higher-quality content. Thanks and I hope you have a great weekend!</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog! I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not used to writing about my life, so instead of a recollection of some distant memory I&#39;ll just make up a few questions and answer them.
Why did you make a blog? I&#39;d been considering creating a blog for some time now. It seemed like a good way of sharing my thoughts while gaining the catharsis that comes with expressing myself. However, I&#39;m also a painfully reserved person, and my fear of opening up kept me from making this site earlier.</description>
