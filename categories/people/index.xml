      <description>I opened my eyes to darkness. It was some ungodly hour on Saturday morning, and I was struggling to make sense of a scene I just saw. I remembered the details really well,1 but how did everything happen if I had just been sleeping? It took a couple seconds before the realization hit me that I had been dreaming.2
Later that day, I recounted this occurrence to a friend, and he wondered if there was something more to the whole thing.</description>

      <description>(DISCLAIMER: In case it wasn&#39;t obvious enough, this will be a pretty somber post. You&#39;ve been warned.)
Meet James. James is a rising senior at TJ. James likes to run and has been a part of TJ&#39;s cross-country and track teams. He&#39;s also passionate about photography and videography.
Oh, sorry. Did I write &amp;quot;is&amp;quot;? Because I meant to write &amp;quot;was&amp;quot;. Sadly, today marks one week since James committed suicide.
James wasn&#39;t the first TJ student to unexpectedly pass away&amp;ndash;he wasn&#39;t even the first in his own graduating class&amp;ndash;but his death is the latest item added to a laundry list of mental health concerns at the school.</description>

      <title>Sped Up</title>

      <description>I have an interesting quirk when it comes to classical music: I like to speed my music up. It&#39;s not drastic&amp;ndash;usually anywhere from 5 to 15%, depending on the piece&amp;ndash;but it is noticeable. I have friends who do similar things with TV programs or movies they might be watching, and it got me thinking about our attention spans. What&#39;s the use of consuming sped-up content, and why do we prefer it to normal speed?</description>

      <description>I just finished containerizing this site1, and it had me thinking.
In the systems administration world, a container is a small virtual environment that can be used to run a program or service. These little things are made using templates called images. There are a few advantages to this model:
 Containers are pretty easy to create. They&#39;re also easy and clean to delete. They&#39;re more isolated than just running on bare metal, i.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been noticing something over the last few weeks&amp;ndash;I like to crack jokes. A lot. Here are just a few examples from recent text conversations: 1
 When I failed to properly read information about the school district opening back up for the next school year: &amp;quot;Hey, they only mentioned science and technology in our school&#39;s name, not literacy.&amp;quot; 2 After reading a post by the principal about how we were more than our our GPAs: &amp;quot;Dr.</description>
