      <description>That&#39;s right. I&#39;m being lazy again. At this rate, I&#39;ll give up posting by the end of the week, won&#39;t I?
Treat yourself to another essay I wrote for English. Technically, it was a rewrite of a prior one, but this was so much better than the original my English teacher became suspicious that I had stolen it. (For the record, this essay is completely original.)
 In the Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer uses the medium of short stories to examine various elements of society in 14th-century England.</description>

      <description>Wow. Today marks the 15th day that I&#39;ve posted on this blog. I didn&#39;t expect to get this far, honestly.
I have nothing original to post, so here&#39;s an essay I wrote for virtual English class:
 Frankenstein’s monster is a complex character. Ostensibly the villain of the novel bearing his creator’s name, he turns out to be a pitiful character, shunned many times over by society. The most obvious cause for his rejection by people was his appearance, which was bestowed upon him by Victor Frankenstein.</description>
