As soon as you saw the title of this post, you probably thought this would be about one of two things:

* Actual ghosts, like [Casper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_the_Friendly_Ghost)
* Ghosting

The second is correct. Congratulations!

I\'ve noticed a fair bit of \"leaving on delivered\" going on lately, and I\'ve been both the recipient and the perpetrator. (In the latter scenario, it was because I would keep getting involved with something and forgetting to check my messages, though my laziness did also start to protest my attempts to help others with their CS work.) Inspired by these incidents, I\'ve decided to write this post regarding the related (more long-term) concept of ghosting. What is ghosting, you ask? Well, in this context it refers to someone basically giving you the online silent treatment over a long period of time. Imagine one day, your friend (partner, family member, colleague) stops communicating with you over all channels. A long time passes but you still haven\'t heard from them. That\'s ghosting. It can be pretty painful due to its abruptness and the inability to find out just *why* it occurred.

What kinds of people are likely to ghost others? Well:

* In the world of [attachment theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory), it\'s believed by some that individuals with an avoidant type personality are likely to ghost others since they\'re reluctant to get close to other people.
* Believers in destiny are also more prone to ghosting.
* People who have been ghosted themselves, interestingly. It reminds me of the whole \"many bullies have been bullied themselves\" thing.

Why do people ghost others, you ask? A few reasons include:

* Fear of the unknown!
* Conflict avoidance!
* Lack of consequences!
* Self-care!

In general, ghosting is basically a way of ending a relationship without having to say anything--just cut someone off and avoid them as much as possible! Simple as that!

Seriously, though, ghosting can have a severe mental toll on the recipient, who doesn\'t really understand why this is happening to them. If you\'ve been ghosted, some things you can do to move on are:

* Don\'t automatically blame yourself. This is big. It\'s not necessarily the fault of the person who\'s been ghosted.
* Don\'t fall back on unhealthy coping mechanisms. It\'s not worth it.
* Spend time with friends and family.
* If you\'re really hurt, seek professional help. Unlike the second point, this one *is* worth it.

I will admit that I don\'t personally have a lot of experience with ghosting. However, I do understand that it can be pretty tough. I hope this post was a little enlightening about why ghosting occurs and how to get past it.

Now, if anyone has a Casper the Friendly Ghost joke that I could close out this post with, let me know...
