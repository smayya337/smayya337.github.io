As soon as you saw the title of this post, you probably thought this would be about one of two things:

* Actual ghosts, like [Casper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_the_Friendly_Ghost)
* Ghosting

The second is correct. Congratulations!

I\'ve noticed a fair bit of \"leaving on delivered\" going on lately, and I\'ve been both the recipient and the perpetrator.[^1] Inspired by these incidents, I\'ve decided to look at the related (more long-term) concept of ghosting. What is ghosting, you ask? Well, in this context it refers to someone basically giving you the online silent treatment over a long period of time. Imagine one day, your friend (partner, family member, colleague) stops communicating with you over all channels. A long time passes but you still haven\'t heard from them. That\'s ghosting. It can be pretty painful due to its abruptness and the inability to find out just *why* it occurred. Thankfully, there\'s a fix for that last problem: I\'ll just explain why ghosting occurs![^2]

[^1]: In the latter scenario, it was because I would keep getting involved with something and forgetting to check my messages, though my laziness did also start to protest my attempts to help others with their CS work.

[^2]: My comedic exposition is a bit messed up right now...

**OK, fine--I forgot to finish this. Just wait until tomorrow.**
