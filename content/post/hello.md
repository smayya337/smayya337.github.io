Welcome to my blog! I'll be the first to admit I'm not used to writing about my life, so instead of some recollection of some distant memory I'll just make up some questions and answer them.

## Why did you make a blog?

I've been considering creating a blog for some time now. It seemed like a good way of sharing my thoughts while gaining the catharsis that comes with expressing myself. However, I'm also a painfully reserved person, and my fear of opening up kept me from making this site earlier. I suppose what really pushed me over the edge was seeing some of my friends make [their own blogs](https://michellecdu.wixsite.com/musingswithmichelle).

## What are you going to post on here?

I don't really know. Whatever I feel like, I guess.

## How did you make this site?

I used the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to make this site. The theme is [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme). The background image is the Flow wallpaper that came with the [KDE Plasma 5.19 desktop](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.19.0). I added a 32px-radius Gaussian blur on it using [GIMP](https://gimp.org).
