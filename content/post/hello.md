Welcome to my blog! I'll admit I'm not used to writing about my life, so instead of a recollection of some distant memory I'll just make up a few questions and answer them.

## Why did you make a blog?

I'vd been considering creating a blog for some time now. It seemed like a good way of sharing my thoughts while gaining the catharsis that comes with expressing myself. However, I'm also a painfully reserved person, and my fear of opening up kept me from making this site earlier. I suppose what really got me to do this was seeing some of my friends make [their own blogs](https://michellecdu.wixsite.com/musingswithmichelle).

## What are you going to post on here?

I don't really know. Whatever I feel like posting, I guess.

## How did you make this site?

I used the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to make this site. The theme is [Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme). The background image is the Flow wallpaper that came with the [KDE Plasma 5.19 desktop](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.19.0). I added a 32px-radius Gaussian blur on it using [GIMP](https://gimp.org). You can check out the corresponding GitHub repo [here!](https://github.com/smayya337/smayya337.github.io)

## How often will you update this blog?

[Yes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/InclusiveOr/)
