Today, by my count, is the 19th consecutive day that I have posted on this blog, and I\'ve realized that it is a bit untenable for me to continue to post on a daily basis. To that end, I\'ll be shifting to weekly updates so that I don\'t feel as rushed and can put out higher-quality content. Thanks and I hope you have a great weekend!
