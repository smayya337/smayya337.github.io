Today, June 26, marks 15 weeks since my first day in quarantine. For reference, that\'s a long time.[^1] Since I don\'t want to review Java graphics concepts (¿Qué es un búfer?), I figured I would look back on the events leading up to the closing of in-person school.[^2]

[^1]: For an actual reference, summer vacation is about 10.5 weeks long.

[^2]: This is not comprehensive--a lot of stuff happened that I probably forgot about.

## March 6, 2020

* Virginia Science Olympiad sent out an email saying that they were monitoring the situation.

## March 7, 2020

* Southern California Science Olympiad decided to cancel their state tournament. This was a surprise--they were the first state to do so--and also a move that shook up the playing field quite a bit. SoCal was a force to be reckoned with on the national circuit.

## March 8, 2020

* New York Science Olympiad canceled all their remaining tournaments. Also a shock, since New York was a very competitive state.

## March 9, 2020

* Actually, I don\'t remember much happening on this day, strange as it may sound.[^3]

[^3]: This means that something super important probably happened that day.

## March 10, 2020

* FCPS canceled overnight trips. The TJSO officers were now scrambling to figure out transportation to the state tournament.[^4]
* I asked a friend for a favor: would her sister, a TJSO alumna who was on spring break, be willing to come to the TJSO meeting on the 18th? I figured it would be a morale boost for the older members of the team.[^5]

[^4]: I had been putting off an email about transportation and finally sent it that morning. That was a waste of my time.

[^5]: The sister graciously obliged, though in hindsight this could have been a safety hazard--she had been out-of-state for school and TJ very well might have already been exposed to the virus. Also, there\'s not a lot of space to spread out during SO meetings, even with the smaller team.

## March 11, 2020

* North Carolina Science Olympiad canceled all their tournaments. This was the big one--nationals was supposed to be at NC State.
* Without a national tournament, Virginia canceled the state tournament soon after. The SO season was over. This one probably hurt the most for me personally, since I had been hoping to go back to nats and maybe medal this time.
* FCPS closed school for the upcoming Monday, the 16th, in order to figure out their coronavirus plans.

## March 12, 2020

* No one really knew what would happen at this point with school--we were all just waiting for Monday.
* I took the National Latin exam during second period. In keeping with tradition, I got a 39 out of 40 for the third year in a row.
* I stopped by the CSL to pick up a networking switch that had been causing some issues. I brought it home that day to fix it.[^6]
* At the end of the day, the principal announced that school was on for the next day, much to the audible displeasure of the student body.
* I learned on the bus ride back home that the Pi-Miler, a 5K scheduled for that Saturday, was canceled, but the principal didn\'t want to admit it was because of the coronavirus.

[^6]: It didn\'t need fixing.

## March 13, 2020[^7]

* I had an English group project due this day and we were nowhere close to finished. I was desperately hoping school would close or I could skip class to make some progress on it. I got my wish. School was closed for the day.
* Later that day, it was announced that school would be closed for the next month, all the way through spring break.

[^7]: It\'s kind of fitting that quarantine started on Friday the 13th.
