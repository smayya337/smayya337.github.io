Nothing hurts quite like a lukewarm response.

You\'ve probably seen or felt it before: telling someone about a subject you really enjoy only to have them respond with a dismissive \"Yeah, that\'s cool\", or a stand-up comedian delivering their best joke to a crowd and receiving almost no laughs in return. It\'s pretty awful. Boredom (or at least the perception of it) is anathema to the entertainer--a sign that the audience doesn\'t care about what they have to say, that they failed at the most important element of what they\'re supposed to be doing.

But what exactly is boredom? It\'s been defined variously, but in general boredom is a state where you aren\'t super interested in the current activity and have issues focusing on it.[^1] There are three main types of boredom:

[^1]: For example, you may be disinterested in my rambling about boredom and have trouble focusing while trying to read this post.

* When you can\'t do something you want to do
* When you\'re forced to so something you don\'t want to do
* When you just can\'t stay engaged in whatever you\'re doing

Being bored is normal, but high proneness to boredom (which has its own scale and everything) is often linked to attention failures, and possibly could be related to depression and a variety of other problems. Many conditions can be symptoms of boredom:

* Absent-mindedness, in which a person is often inattentive or forgetful[^2]
* Lethargy, in which a person has low energy and is often tired or weary

[^2]: Like me! Wait. What were we talking about again?

Boredom is a normal behavior, and it\'s OK to be bored. The problem with the lukewarm response, though, is that you\'re *coming off* as bored of the other person, which can be quite deflating. It\'s really about the impression--if you act like you\'re engaged by someone, it makes them feel like they have something valuable to say, which is incredibly uplifting.

I guess the point of this ramble is just to say that insipid, disinterested responses can be kind of hurtful, and that they\'re worth avoiding. It\'s why I don\'t like to react to messages or posts with simple \"like\" or \"thumbs up\" reactions. So next time someone keeps going on about something, even if you aren\'t super engaged by it, try to appear like you are--it\'s the least you could do.[^3]

[^3]: Before anyone asks what the motivation behind writing this was: there really wasn\'t one. It just came to me while I was thinking about stuff to write.
