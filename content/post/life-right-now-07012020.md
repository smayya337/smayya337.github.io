I don't have much to ruminate upon today, so instead here's a look at my life right now:

* Summer CS has been going relatively well--since I've done most of the labs beforehand, I just make sure that they work and put all the classes into one file before going and doing something else.

* I finished writing up part one of this year's edition of my annual TJMC show piano arrangement last night. It's a lot more pedal-heavy than the scores of previous years, but I like it! It's also a lot more readable, which has been an issue in the past (and one that I'm now trying to fix with the 2019 arrangement).

* I played a bunch of [*Civilization 6*](https://civilization.com) today, and I got my first non-score victory! It was a science victory that I got as the German Empire with eight or so turns left in the game. I also nuked the Aztec capital twice for declaring war on me. That was pretty satisfying.

* I also started season two of *Avatar: The Last Airbender* today with my sister.

That's about it for me. Overall, life is pretty chill! (At least, if you ignore [the emails that I need to write](/2020/06/emails/)...)
