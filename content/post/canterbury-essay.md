That\'s right. I\'m being lazy again. At this rate, I\'ll give up posting by the end of the week, won\'t I?

Treat yourself to another essay I wrote for English. Technically, it was a rewrite of a prior one, but this was so much better than the original my English teacher became suspicious that I had stolen it. (For the record, this essay is completely original.)

> In the *Canterbury Tales*, Geoffrey Chaucer uses the medium of short stories to examine various elements of society in 14th-century England. Each of his tales investigates a different topic, ranging from corruption in the Catholic Church to courtly love. One of these stories is the Wife of Bath’s Tale, which is narrated through the character of a middle-aged widow. On the surface, it is a story about a knight who wishes to save himself from execution; however, Chaucer uses it as a vehicle for looking at sexism and the importance of ancestry. In a speech during the Wife of Bath’s Tale, Geoffrey Chaucer uses extended metaphors of inheritance and plants to express the unimportance of lineage compared to doing good works in God’s name.

> Chaucer compares the passing down of good traits to an inheritance in the first part of the dialogue. The knight who serves as the tale’s protagonist, after being forced to marry an old woman, complains about his new wife to her face, taking particular notice of her low birth and ugliness. As part of her response to his vitriol, the old lady informs him that people get their goodness from Christ, \"[n]ot from a wealth of ancestry long dim\" (288). She goes on to explain, \"‘Our fathers cannot make us a bequest / Of all those virtues that became them best / And earned for them the name of gentlemen / And bade us follow them best we can.’\" (288) Chaucer includes his metaphor through words such as \"wealth\", \"bequest\", and \"earn\" to express that goodness (the cause of nobility, in his view) is not something that can be passed on from one generation to the next (made a bequest of); instead, it must be sought after and attained by the individual who desires it through good works.

> The author then proceeds to expound upon this idea using the extended metaphor of plants. The old woman uses a quote by Dante to prove her point: \"‘Thus the wise poet of the Florentines, / Dante by name, has written in these lines, / For such is the opinion Dante launches: / \"Seldom arises by these slender branches / Prowess of men, for it is God, no less, / Wills us to claim of Him our gentleness.\"’\" (288) The plant references begin with the mention of \"slender branches\" by Dante, and they continue as the old lady asks her husband, \"‘[I]f gentility were implanted by / The natural course of lineage down the line, / Public or private, could it cease to shine / In doing the fair work of gentle deed? No vice or villainy could then bear seed.’\" (288-289) Chaucer continues the metaphor started by Dante with terms like \"implanted\", \"natural\", and \"seed\" as he sets forth the argument that good works prevent people from sinning, and that who a person is born to (the \"natural course of lineage\") is irrelevant in carrying out the mission of the Lord, as God Himself grants people their gentility.

> Geoffrey Chaucer uses the English language skillfully in the *Canterbury Tales*, a work of literature that still effectively conveys its author’s thoughts over six hundred years after it was written. He uses an extended metaphor involving inheritance to show that noble lineage is useless, as people obtain a high standing through the use of good traits that cannot be passed down through their bloodline. Chaucer then develops on an extended metaphor by Dante involving plants to explain that one’s priority in life should be doing good deeds out of piety, and that nobility will come as a consequence of such actions. While the old lady in the Wife of Bath’s Tale might have proved that goodness cannot be bequeathed, Chaucer certainly bequeathed something of his own—a remarkable legacy as a master of English verse that holds strong centuries later.
