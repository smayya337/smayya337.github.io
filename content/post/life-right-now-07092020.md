Here\'s how life is right now:

* The CSL went down for a few days due to lack of an A/C. (The machine room gets *hot* when there\'s nothing to regulate the temperature.) Thankfully, everything is coming back up, and I don\'t think there was any major damage to anything.
* We\'re beginning work on the TJSO diagnostic! There is much to do on that front (and my physics knowledge has been tested multiple times already. I need to brush up on my understanding of Newton\'s laws.)
* FCPS has apparently canceled field trips for the upcoming school year. That means no competitions for TJMC or TJSO, and HackTJ 8.0 will be a bit problematic.
* After the disaster that was [Asteroids](/2020/06/asteroids/), summer CS is back to being chill. Thank goodness.
* I still haven\'t finished [those emails](/2020/06/emails/)...
