Well, I distrohopped again. Even better, I hopped back to where I was before [the last time I hopped](/2020/06/distro-updates/).

* On my laptop, I\'m using [**openSUSE Tumbleweed**](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed). The more up-to-date Plasma in the official repos enticed me back.
* On my secondary PC/server, I\'m using [**openSUSE Leap 15.2**](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap) for consistency, and also because I hadn\'t tried the recently-released 15.2 version.
