I would just like to express my extreme frustration and disappointment at the fact that I spent seven hours working on (part of!) a CS project, only to find out upon submitting that a lot of shell code had been uploaded six hours prior with no notice. Thanks for reading--I\'m going to go drown my sorrows in... something or the other, I guess.
