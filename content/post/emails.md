I have to send out a bunch of emails. The recipients: potential sponsors for HackTJ 7.5, a virtual version of the school's annual hackathon that's set to take place in November. I know whom I'm supposed to contact, and more or less what to talk about in my messages. I even double-checked everything the other day to make sure I wasn't mistaken. So why don't I want to do it?

The thought of sending emails to people I don't know instills a strange sense of dread in me, a feeling that I would otherwise only get from dentist appointments,[^1] swimming lessons,[^2] and freshman gym.[^3] The kicker here, though, is that I won't really end up knowing any of these people personally: one of the people on my list is literally Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square. I doubt most of these people will even *read* my email, much less respond to me. What's the problem, then?

[^1]: I'm not the poster child for pearly whites. In fact, I'd probably say I'm the poster child for how *not* to maintain your pearly whites. I had to visit earlier this month and it turns out that I don't have any cavities right now. That's the first time I've heard that in years!

[^2]: My parents spent thousands--maybe tens of thousands--of dollars putting me in swimming lessons for nine years. I gained two things from them: the ability to swim (albeit very poorly), and PTSD. I'm scared of swimming pools now.

[^3]: I also got PTSD from that class. Never again.

I guess my fear is that I will be judged anyway, maybe for writing a shoddy email, or contacting the wrong person, or just for cluttering someone's inbox with information regarding a hackathon that they don't care about. I know, it's pretty irrational, but it bugs me nonetheless. I'll have to get the emails written and sent sometime--probably before our team meeting on Friday. But there are still two more days until then (three if you include the day of), and I don't think the others have finished either. Besides, Wednesday sounds like a good "email writing" day...
