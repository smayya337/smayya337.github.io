I have an interesting quirk when it comes to classical music: I like to speed my music up. It\'s not drastic--usually anywhere from 5 to 15%, depending on the piece--but it is noticeable. I have friends who do similar things with TV programs or movies they might be watching, and it got me thinking about our attention spans. Are we really just too restless to sit through our shows/films/tunes, or is there another reason?
