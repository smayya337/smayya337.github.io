      <description>Wow. Today marks the 15th day that I&#39;ve posted on this blog. I didn&#39;t expect to get this far, honestly.
I have nothing original to post, so here&#39;s an essay I wrote for virtual English class:

The most obvious cause for his rejection by people was his appearance, which was bestowed upon him by Victor Frankenstein.</description>
