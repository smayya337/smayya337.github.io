      <description>Nothing hurts quite like a lukewarm response.
You&#39;ve probably seen or felt it before: telling someone about a subject you really enjoy only to have them respond with a dismissive &amp;quot;Yeah, that&#39;s cool&amp;quot;, or a stand-up comedian delivering their best joke to a crowd and receiving almost no laughs in return. It&#39;s pretty awful. Boredom (or at least the perception of it) is anathema to the entertainer&amp;ndash;a sign that the audience doesn&#39;t care about what they have to say, that they failed at the most important element of what they&#39;re supposed to be doing.</description>
