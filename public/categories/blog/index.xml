      <description>Welcome to my blog! I&amp;rsquo;ll admit I&amp;rsquo;m not used to writing about my life, so instead of a recollection of some distant memory I&amp;rsquo;ll just make up a few questions and answer them.
Why did you make a blog? I&amp;rsquo;vd been considering creating a blog for some time now. It seemed like a good way of sharing my thoughts while gaining the catharsis that comes with expressing myself. However, I&amp;rsquo;m also a painfully reserved person, and my fear of opening up kept me from making this site earlier.</description>
