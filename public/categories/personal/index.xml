      <description>That&#39;s right. I&#39;m being lazy again. At this rate, I&#39;ll give up posting by the end of the week, won&#39;t I?
Treat yourself to another essay I wrote for English. Technically, it was a rewrite of a prior one, but this was so much better than the original my English teacher became suspicious that I had stolen it. (For the record, this essay is completely original.)
 In the Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer uses the medium of short stories to examine various elements of society in 14th-century England.</description>

      <description>Wow. Today marks the 15th day that I&#39;ve posted on this blog. I didn&#39;t expect to get this far, honestly.
I have nothing original to post, so here&#39;s an essay I wrote for virtual English class:
 Frankenstein’s monster is a complex character. Ostensibly the villain of the novel bearing his creator’s name, he turns out to be a pitiful character, shunned many times over by society. The most obvious cause for his rejection by people was his appearance, which was bestowed upon him by Victor Frankenstein.</description>

      <description>People have lately been sharing their experiences as members of under-represented groups at TJ, so I thought I&#39;d touch on my own experience. It&#39;s not a race thing or a gender thing or even an income thing (I&#39;m an Indian boy from a fairly well-off family, which is about as TJ as it gets), but more of a location thing.
(Also, my writing is probably going to turn out horrible. You&#39;ve been warned.</description>

      <description>I would just like to express my extreme frustration and disappointment at the fact that I spent seven hours working on (part of!) a CS project, only to find out upon submitting that a lot of shell code had been uploaded six hours prior with no notice. Thanks for reading&amp;ndash;I&#39;m going to go drown my sorrows in&amp;hellip; something or the other, I guess.</description>

      <description>I don&#39;t have much to ruminate upon today, so instead here&#39;s a look at my life right now:
  Summer CS has been going relatively well&amp;ndash;since I&#39;ve done most of the labs beforehand, I just make sure that they work and put all the classes into one file before going and doing something else.
  I finished writing up part one of this year&#39;s edition of my annual TJMC show piano arrangement last night.</description>

      <description>I have to send out a bunch of emails. The recipients: potential sponsors for HackTJ 7.5, a virtual version of the school&#39;s annual hackathon that&#39;s set to take place in November. I know whom I&#39;m supposed to contact, and more or less what to talk about in my messages. I even double-checked everything the other day to make sure I wasn&#39;t mistaken. So why don&#39;t I want to do it?</description>

      <description>At TJ, a large portion of the student body comes from households where English isn&#39;t the only language spoken. Their families might converse in Tamil or Telugu, Chinese or Korean1&amp;ndash;and as a result, most of the kids from those backgrounds are fluent in their families&#39; native tongues. It&#39;s impressive&amp;hellip; and a bit disheartening, honestly. You see, I&#39;m from one of those households, but I&#39;ve always struggled to speak the language of my family, and it&#39;s caused me some problems.</description>

      <description>I just finished containerizing this site1, and it had me thinking.
In the systems administration world, a container is a small virtual environment that can be used to run a program or service. These little things are made using templates called images. There are a few advantages to this model:
 Containers are pretty easy to create. They&#39;re also easy and clean to delete. They&#39;re more isolated than just running on bare metal, i.</description>

      <description>Today, June 26, marks 15 weeks since my first day in quarantine. For reference, that&#39;s a long time.1 Since I don&#39;t want to review Java graphics concepts (¿Qué es un búfer?), I figured I would look back on the events leading up to the closing of in-person school.2
March 6, 2020  Virginia Science Olympiad sent out an email saying that they were monitoring the situation.  March 7, 2020  Southern California Science Olympiad decided to cancel their state tournament.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been noticing something over the last few weeks&amp;ndash;I like to crack jokes. A lot. Here are just a few examples from recent text conversations: 1
 When I failed to properly read information about the school district opening back up for the next school year: &amp;quot;Hey, they only mentioned science and technology in our school&#39;s name, not literacy.&amp;quot; 2 After reading a post by the principal about how we were more than our our GPAs: &amp;quot;Dr.</description>
