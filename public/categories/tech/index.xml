      <description>I would just like to express my extreme frustration and disappointment at the fact that I spent seven hours working on (part of!) a CS project, only to find out upon submitting that a lot of shell code had been uploaded six hours prior with no notice. Thanks for reading&amp;ndash;I&#39;m going to go drown my sorrows in&amp;hellip; something or the other, I guess.</description>

      <description>I just finished containerizing this site1, and it had me thinking.
In the systems administration world, a container is a small virtual environment that can be used to run a program or service. These little things are made using templates called images. There are a few advantages to this model:

      <description>As if it wasn&#39;t already abundantly clear that I have too much time on my hands, I did some distrohopping today.
What is distrohopping? For the uninitiated, distrohopping is the practice of jumping between Linux distributions (or &amp;quot;distros&amp;quot;) because&amp;hellip; well, because you can, I suppose. (I want to write a longer post about distrohopping, so keep an eye out for that!)

      <description>Welcome to my blog! I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not used to writing about my life, so instead of a recollection of some distant memory I&#39;ll just make up a few questions and answer them.
